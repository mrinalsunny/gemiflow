# V3 Module Development

This directory contains the V3 monorepo packages. Root CLAUDE.md rules apply here.

## Build & Test

```bash
# From v3/@gemiflow/<package>
npm install && npm run build && npm test
```

## Packages

| Package | Path | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| `@gemiflow/cli` | `@gemiflow/cli/` | CLI entry point (26 commands, 140+ subcommands) |
| `@gemiflow/guidance` | `@gemiflow/guidance/` | Governance control plane (compile, enforce, prove, evolve) |
| `@gemiflow/hooks` | `@gemiflow/hooks/` | 17 hooks + 12 background workers |
| `@gemiflow/memory` | `@gemiflow/memory/` | AgentDB + HNSW vector search |
| `@gemiflow/shared` | `@gemiflow/shared/` | Shared types and utilities |
| `@gemiflow/security` | `@gemiflow/security/` | Input validation, path security, CVE remediation |

## Code Quality

- Files under 500 lines
- No hardcoded secrets
- Input validation at system boundaries
- Typed interfaces for all public APIs
- TDD London School (mock-first) preferred
- Event sourcing for state changes

## Performance Targets

> Source of truth: [`docs/reviews/intelligence-system-audit-2026-05-29.md`](../docs/reviews/intelligence-system-audit-2026-05-29.md) + [`scripts/benchmark-intelligence.mjs`](../scripts/benchmark-intelligence.mjs). Numbers below are measured unless marked "target/unverified".

| Metric | Measured / Target | Status |
|--------|-------------------|--------|
| HNSW Search | ~1.9x at N=20k, ~3.2x–4.7x at N=5k vs brute force (recall@10 ~0.99) | **Measured** (ruvector NAPI; 150x-12,500x NOT reproduced) |
| Int8 Quantization | 3.84x compression, reconstruction cosine 0.99999 | **Measured** |
| RaBitQ Quantization | 32x compression, 0.60ms/query | **Measured** |
| SONA Adaptation | 0.0043ms/adapt (target <0.05ms met) | **Measured** |
| MCP Response | <100ms | target |
| CLI Startup | <500ms | target |
| Flash Attention | 2.49x-7.47x | **Unverified** (no benchmark) |
